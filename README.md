# CS232
The objective of the code was to create a number guessing game. The computer will generate a random number from 1-100 and you have to guess it but it gives your hints. If your guess is larger than the number you need to guess it will tell you to high and if its lower it will tell you to low. It also tells you how many times it took you to guess that number once you guess correct.
